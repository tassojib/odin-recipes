<h2>Zucchini Bars</h2>
<p>This snack cake is so delicious that my family can eat the entire batch in one day! Very easy and moist.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, mix together the eggs, oil, sugar and vanilla until well blended. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; stir into the sugar mixture. Mix in the zucchini. Spread the batter evenly into the prepared pan.</li>
<li>Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.
